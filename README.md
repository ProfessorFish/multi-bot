# Welcome to multi-bot!

**This bot is under development so more features will be added as I work on it.**


**DOWNLOAD AND HOST LOCALLY:**

1) Press on code button

2) Click download

3) When the download has finished, unzip the file.

4) Open setup.js and edit the values as required

5) If you haven't already, download nodejs

6) Open command prompt

7) Run cd YOUR_FILE_DIRECTORY_TO_FOLDER

8) Run npm start

OR

Ignore stages 6-8

6) Open a code editor (Like visual studio code)

7) Run the code

**HOST FOR FREE ON THE WEB:**

Options:
https://railway.app (requires that you have a github account at least 1 month old but in my opinion is the best hosting method as long as you arent going to change the files alot)

1) Fork the github and edit the setup.js **IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE THIS FORK IS SET TO PRIVATE**

2) Go to https://railway.app

3) Sign in with github

4) Create a new project

5) Choose to create with github

6) Select your forked github repo

7) Its hosted!

*(If you push anything to the repo then it will automatically rebuild! This is good if you're not using a local database or using the database at all, but not so good if your using a local database as it will delete all locally stored data. However you can add some simple code to the shutdown command to make it dm you the latest version of the data file before you push to the github, so it isn't a big issue. If you need help with any of these steps please join the discord below!)*
